# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

socat: socat (multipurpose data relay)
socat:
socat: socat is a relay for bidirectional data transfer between two
socat: independent data channels. Each of these data channels may be a file,
socat: pipe, device (serial line etc. or a pseudo terminal), a socket (UNIX,
socat: IP4, IP6 - raw, UDP, TCP), an SSL socket, proxy CONNECT connection,
socat: a file descriptor (stdin etc.), the GNU line editor (readline),
socat: a program, or a combination of two of these.  These modes include
socat: generation of "listening" sockets, named pipes, and pseudo terminals.
