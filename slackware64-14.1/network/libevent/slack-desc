# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libevent: Libevent
libevent:
libevent: The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function
libevent: when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout
libevent: has been reached. Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due to
libevent: signals or regular timeouts. 
libevent:
libevent: libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven
libevent: network servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch()
libevent: and then add or remove events dynamically without having to change
libevent: the event loop.
