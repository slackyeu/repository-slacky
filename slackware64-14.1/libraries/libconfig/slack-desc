# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libconfig: Libconfig is a simple library for processing structured

libconfig: readable than XML. And unlike XML, it is type-aware, so it is not
libconfig: necessary to do string parsing in application code.

libconfig: Libconfig is very compact - a fraction of the size of the expat XML
libconfig: parser library. This makes it well-suited for memory-constrained
libconfig: systems like handheld devices.
