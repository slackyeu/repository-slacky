# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

recode:
recode: The `recode' converts files between character sets and usages.
recode: It recognises or produces nearly 150 different character sets and
recode: is able to transliterate files between almost any pair. When exact
recode: transliteration are not possible, it may get rid of the offending
recode: characters or fall back on approximations. Most RFC 1345 character
recode: sets are supported.
