# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

cdrkit: Youngdale and others, cdda2wav  by  Heiko Eissfeldt, and  cdrecord by
cdrkit: Jörg Schilling. However, cdrkit is  not affiliated with any  of these
cdrkit: authors; it is now an independent project.
