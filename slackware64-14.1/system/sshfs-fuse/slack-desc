# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

sshfs-fuse: sshfs-fuse (ssh file system module for FUSE)
sshfs-fuse:
sshfs-fuse: This is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer
sshfs-fuse: Protocol. Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it
sshfs-fuse: is very easy to set up: i.e. on the server side there's nothing
sshfs-fuse: to do.  On the client side mounting the filesystem is as easy as
sshfs-fuse: logging into the server with ssh.
