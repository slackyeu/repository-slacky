# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

recode: Recode (Character Filter Converter)
recode:
recode: It recognises or produces more than 300 different character  sets and
recode: transliterates   files    between   almost   any  pair.   When  exact
recode: transliteration are not possible, it gets rid of offending characters
recode: or falls back on  approximations.   The  `recode'  program is a handy
recode: front-end to the library.
