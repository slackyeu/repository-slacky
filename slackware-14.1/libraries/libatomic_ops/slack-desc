# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libatomic_ops: Libatomic-op (A library for atomic operations)
libatomic_ops:
libatomic_ops: Libatomic-ops implements a large collection of operations, each one
libatomic_ops: of which is a combination of an (optional) atomic memory operation,
libatomic_ops: and a memory barrier. It also implements associated feature-test
libatomic_ops: macros that determine whether a particular operation is available
libatomic_ops: on the current target hardware (either directly or by synthesis).
libatomic_ops: Libatomic-ops attempts to replace various existing files with
libatomic_ops: similar goals, since they usually do not handle differences in
libatomic_ops: memory barrier styles with sufficient generality.
