# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libmatroska: Matroska (Audio/Video Container Library)
libmatroska:
libmatroska: Matroska is  usually  found as .mkv  files (matroska video) and .mka
libmatroska: files (matroska audio). Matroska  aims  to  become  THE  standard of
libmatroska: multimedia  container formats. It was  derived from a project called
libmatroska: MCF, but differentiates from it significantly because it is based on
libmatroska: EBML (Extensible Binary Meta Language), a binary derivative of XML.
